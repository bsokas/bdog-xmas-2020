# bdog-xmas-2020 (aka MCATivation)

This app is my first full development of a mobile application using React Native. I've been curious about cross-platform development tools for a while now and have been looking for opportunities to try them out and learn more. I've used React extensively professional settings and React Native was the best choice as an entry point to progress quickly. 

This repo uses the most recent version of React Native and the development code is written in TypeScript:
- [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- [TypeScript guides and introduction](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs)

React Native doesn't require TypeScript for typing. It includes support for [Flow](https://flow.org/) without any additional installation. I have extensive experience with TypeScript, though, so I opted to use that instead. The syntax betwee the two is highly similar so it's likely you could switch between the two easily if you have a good awareness of syntactical differences or use a good linter during development.

## The Project

My significant other is preparing for the MCAT. As part of our holiday gifts to one another we agreed to include at least one "craft" item that we made ourselves. I thought building a simple app would be an interactive way to bring inspiration, stress-relief and humor during an intense period of studies. The app maintains various screens for images of pets and pretty places, inspirational quotes and music.
